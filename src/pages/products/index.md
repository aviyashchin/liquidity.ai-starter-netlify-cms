description: ' Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and we, as machine learning ex- perts, may wonder how we can help. Here we describe how machine learning can be a powerful tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping society adapt to a changing climate. From smart grids to disaster management, we identify high impact problems where existing gaps can be filled by machine learning, in collaboration with other fields. Our recommendations encompass exciting research ques- tions as well as promising business opportunities. We call on the machine learning community to join the global effort against climate change.'

        Climate investment, the current dominant approach in climate finance,
        involves investing money in sustain- able technologies [699]. The
        dominant ways in which major financial institutions take this approach
        are by creating “green” financial indexes that focus on low-carbon
        energy, clean technology, and/or environmental services [700] or by
        designing carbon-neutral investment portfolios that remove or
        under-weigh companies with relatively high carbon footprints [701]. This
        investment strategy is creating major shifts in certain sec- tors of the
        market (e.g. utilities and energy) towards renewable energy
        alternatives, which are seen as having a greater growth potential than
        traditional energy sources such as oil and gas [702]. While this
        approach currently does not utilize ML directly, we see the potential in
        applying deep learning both for portfolio se- lection (based on features
        of the stocks involved) and investment timing (using historical patterns
        to predict future demand), to maximize both the impact and scope of
        climate investment strategies.

        The other main approach to climate finance is climate analytics, which
        aims to predict the financial effects of climate change, and is still
        gaining momentum in the mainstream financial community [699]. Since this
        is a predictive approach to addressing climate change from a financial
        perspective, it is one where ML can potentially make a greater impact.
        Climate analytics involves analyzing investment portfolios, funds and
        companies in order to pinpoint areas with heightened risk due to climate
        change, such as timber companies that could be bankrupted by wildfires
        or water extraction initiatives that could see their source polluted by
        shifting landscapes. Approaches used in this field include: using NLP
        techniques for identifying climate risks and investment opportunities in
        disclosures made by companies [703] as well as for analyzing the evo-
        lution of media coverage of climate change to dynamically hedge climate
        change risk [704]; using econo- metric approaches for developing
        arbitrage strategies that take advantage of the carbon risk factor in
        financial markets [705]; and ML approaches for forecasting the price of
        carbon in emission exchanges59 [707, 708].

        To date, the field of climate finance has been largely neglected within
        the larger scope of financial re- search and analysis. This leaves many
        directions for improvement, such as (1) improving existing traditional
        portfolio optimization approaches using deep learning; (2) more in-depth
        modeling of the types of variables that constitute climate risk; (3)
        designing a statistical climate factor which can be used for projecting
        the variation of stock prices given a compound set of events; and (4)
        identifying direct and indirect climate risk exposure in annual company
        reports describing their financial performance, among other directions.
        ML plays a central role in these directions, and can play a big role in
        avoiding, or at least mitigating, global climate-related financial
        impacts.

        Machine learning, like all technology, does not always make the world a
        better place – but it can. In the fight against climate change, we have
        seen that ML has significant contributions to offer across domain areas.
        ML can make systems more efficient (e.g. prevent electricity loss during
        transmission, consolidate freight, and reduce food waste). It can enable
        remote sensing and automatic monitoring (e.g. pinpoint deforestation,
        gather data on buildings, and track personal energy use). ML can provide
        fast approximations to time- intensive simulations (e.g. climate models
        and energy scheduling models), and it has the potential to lead to
        interpretable or causal models (e.g. for understanding weather patterns,
        informing policy makers, and planning for disasters). In all these
        cases, we emphasize that ML is only one part of the solution; it is a
        tool that enables other tools across fields.

    The rise and fall of financial markets is linked to many events, both
    sporadic (e.g. the 2008 global financial crisis) and cyclical (e.g. the
    price of gas over the years), with profits and losses that can be measured
    in the billions of dollars and can have global consequences. While the total
    cumulative impact of climate change on global financial assets is estimated
    to be $2.5 trillion, its concrete consequences are unpredictable: it is hard
    to forecast where, how, or when is it going to impact the stock price of a
    given company, or even the debt of an entire nation. While financial
    analysts and investors focus on pricing risk and forecasting potential
    earnings, the majority of the current financial system is based on quarterly
    or yearly performance. This fails to incentivize the prediction of medium or
    long-term risks, which include most climate change- related exposures such
    as its physical impacts on assets or distribution chains, its legislative
    impacts on profit generation, and indirect market consequences such as
    supply and demand.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
