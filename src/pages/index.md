  title: Why Liquidity.ai
  description: >-
    Our software translates the predictions of best-in-class climate models into
    meaningful economic and financial outcomes, so that any business can better
    understand, quantify, and manage their exposure to climate change risk.

    Using our intuitive interface, users can model climate impacts on their
    existing production processes or holdings and explore how alternative
    arrangements modify and mitigate their climate risk exposure.  [CAD features
    simplify the input process; all a user needs to do is place a group of
    ready-made objects in space and define connections between the objects.]

      We also solve many daunting computational problems. Our on-demand
      computation engine makes timely analysis tractable without requiring
      significant investments in new local or cloud-based computing resources.
